The Competition

h2n -- O'Reilly's "DNS and BIND" by Paul Albitz and Cricket Liu
comes with h2n (and an enhanced version is called h2n-hp).  These are
fine DNS generator scripts.  While it can be used for one-time conversion,
there are features that let you maintain the host list as a

dnscvsutil -- Maintains your DNS zone files under CVS control and automatically updates reverse zones.
Hand edit raw zone files?  No way.
Reverse DNS zone generation can be done in a 15-line awk script.

Sauron -- Sauran is a free DNS/DHCP management system with Web and command line interfaces. It can manage multiple servers and generates complete dhcpd and named configurations from the database.

Updatehosts -- A very comprehensive system for managing DNS information.  This is popular
at many large commercial sites. However, the learning curve seems overly steep as it
requires understanding of database relations.  This is not for the neophyte or someone
trying to set up a new site quickly.

DHCP: no

dns -- Builds DNS zones from /etc/hosts file. Similar to h2n, but more comprehensive.
It does not do anything for DHCP users, and generates files directly to their final
destination, which seems dangerous to me.  It seems fine for very small sites with one
domain, which is what it was created for.
