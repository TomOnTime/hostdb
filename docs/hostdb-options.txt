=== hostdb.txt format


The format is similar to /etc/hosts with the ability to add flags to each line.

NOTE: All host names must be FQDNs.

10.1.1.1        myhost.example.com
10.1.1.2        yourhost.example.com MAC=00:e0:81:51:ef:78
64.32.179.56    www.example.com@EXTERNAL  ANAME=my.example.com


=== DHCP_POOL_TEMPLATE and DHCP_POOL

DHCP_POOL instead of a hostname inserts a generic hostname.  For example:

DHCP_POOL_TEMPLATE dhcp-$a-$b-$c-$d.example.com
10.10.0.1	DHCP_POOL
10.10.0.2	DHCP_POOL
10.10.0.3	DHCP_POOL
10.10.0.4	DHCP_POOL

Is the same as:
10.10.0.1	dhcp-10-10-10-1.example.com
10.10.0.2	dhcp-10-10-10-2.example.com
10.10.0.3	dhcp-10-10-10-3.example.com
10.10.0.4	dhcp-10-10-10-4.example.com


=== ANAME= or ANAMES=

Generates additional A records for a IP address.

Example #1:
10.10.10.10	foo.example.com ANAME=bar.example.com

Generates:
foo.example.com.   IN A 10.10.10.10
bar.example.com.   IN A 10.10.10.10

Example #2:

To specify many ANAMEs, separate them with colons.

10.10.10.10	foo.example.com ANAME=bar.example.com:fling.example.com

"ANAME" and "ANAMES" are the same.  Both are used just to be cute.


=== CNAME= or CNAMES=

Generates CNAMEs to a particular host label.  To specify many CNAMEs, separate them with colons (similar to ANAME).

Example:
10.10.10.10	foo.example.com CNAME=bar.example.com

Generates:
foo.example.com.   IN A 10.10.10.10
bar.example.com.   IN CNAME foo.example.com

"CNAME" and "CNAMES" are the same.  Both are used just to be like ANAME.


==== MAC=

Specify the MAC (Media Access Control) or hardware address of a host.  This is only used
by the DHCP system.

Example:
10.10.10.10	foo.example.com MAC=00:e0:81:51:ef:78


=== ISROUTER= or ISMULTIHOMED=

Specify that this host is one of many IP addresses on a router or
multihomed hosts.  (Currently they do the same thing, though ISROUTER=
should be used to indicate that something is a router.  Maybe some
day we'll do something special with that.)

Suppose you have a router with the following 3 IP addresses:

10.10.0.1	zathras-main.example.com ISROUTER=zathras.example.com
10.20.0.1	zathras-net20.example.com ISROUTER=zathras.example.com
10.30.0.1	zathras-net30.example.com ISROUTER=zathras.example.com

Reverse lookups with be to the ISROUTER name (zathras).  Forward
lookups of "zathras.example.com" will return three A records (one
for each interface).  Forward lookups of an individual interface
(zathras-main.example.com for example) will return just one IP
address (10.10.0.1).  This lets you specify "zathras.example.com"
when you mean "any interface" and "zathras-main.example.com" when
you want "that particular interface".  For example, to telnet to
the machine to do maintenance, you would specify zathras.example.com.
However, monitoring systems should refer to the particular IP
addresses.


=== ISMAILSERVER or ISMAILSERVERI

Indicate that this IP address is a email server, and should have special MX records.
In particular:
1.  generate a low numbered (0) MX record pointing to itself
2.  do not generate any duplicate MX records at higher numbers if this host is listed in the default MXs


=== @EXTERNAL

Normally hosts appear in the internal DNS view but the external DNS view offuscates the name.  This
is called "host hiding".  In some cases we want external users to be able to "see" the host's real
name.  We mark those hosts with @EXTERNAL

64.32.179.253	webfarm3.example.com@EXTERNAL

@EXTERNAL can be applied to the host's name, individual ANAMEs, and individual CNAMEs.


=== @EXTERNALONLY

Ok, this one is a little weird.  It is like @EXTERNAL, but the name
will not appear in the internal view of DNS.  Why would you want
this?  Never.  Well, except the one time I needed a host name that
worked outside the company but not within the company.

What was the situation?  Our VPN server was vpn.example.com and I
wanted the VPN client to fail when someone tried using it from
inside the company.  This just made support difficult.  Don't do it.


=== @INBOUNDNAT

When an internal host is accessible from the outside by another IP address (thanks to in-bound NAT or PAT
tricks), the external version of the host should be marked @INBOUNDNAT.

Example:

10.1.1.4        vector.example.com
64.32.179.4     vector.example.com@INBOUNDNAT

This will do the right thing when generating the internal and external zones.  The difference between @INBOUNDNAT and @EXTERNAL is that @EXTERNAL considers it an error if the same name appears twice in hostdb.txt

@INBOUNDNAT can be applied to the host's name, individual ANAMEs, and individual CNAMEs.


=== HINFO

Generate a HINFO DNS record for this host.  Quotes are required if you want to include
spaces (nearly always).  However, individual quotes will be turned into the word "QUOTE"

Note: HINFO records are only generated for INTERNAL zones.  Why you
would want to expose this kind of information to the outside world
is beyond me.

<IP>    <FQDN>  MAC=00:de:ad:be:ef   HINFO="Apple Mac Mini G4":"NetBSD 5.0"
<IP>    <FQDN>  MAC=00:de:ad:be:ef   HINFO="Supermicro PDSMU"
<IP>    <FQDN>  MAC=00:de:ad:be:ef   HINFO=VAX:UNIX

It will be rendered as:
<DN>    IN A   <IP>
        IN HINFO   "Apple Mac Mini G4" "NetBSD 5.0"

<DN>    IN A   <IP>
        IN HINFO   "Supermicro PDSMU" ""

<DN>    IN A   <IP>
        IN HINFO   "VAX" "UNIX"

From RFC 1035 p.14:

   3.3.2. HINFO RDATA format

       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       /                      CPU                      /
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       /                       OS                      /
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   where:

   CPU             A <character-string> which specifies the CPU type.

   OS              A <character-string> which specifies the operating
                   system type.

   Standard values for CPU and OS can be found in [RFC-1010].

   HINFO records are used to acquire general information about a host.  The
   main use is for protocols such as FTP that can use special procedures
   when talking between machines or operating systems of the same type.


From RFC 1010 p.23:

   A system name may be up to 40 characters taken from the set of
   uppercase letters, digits, and the two punctuation characters hyphen
   and slash.  It must start with a letter, and end with a letter or
   digit.
