# Convert a DNS zonefile into a hostdb.txt file.
#  It doesn't do 100% of the work, but certainly does the error-prone parts.
#  It strips out all MX records except for hosts with MX records pointing to
#	themself. Those become "ISMAILSERVER" hosts.
#  It makes a reasonable guess about what are ANAMEs.  The first time it
#	sees an A record for an IP address, it assumes this is the real name.
#	This could be improved by analyzing the PTR records too.

# TODO:
# o  If the in-addr.arpa files are included, use that information to
#	determine which hostname is canonical our of a set of ANAMEs.
