Ok, everything is setup. I have moved the zone file to
/var/named/etc/namedb/master/EXTERNAL.cibernet.com as bind lives in a
chroot environment. I have created a symbolic link in the your zones
directory. Your password for the account is in the PASSWORD file and I
given you access to run the 'rndc reload' command from sudo. Preferred
DNS server name is ns0.lt.nostrum.com. Below is contact information.
