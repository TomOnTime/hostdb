INSTALLATION

1.  Untar someplace (um, you've already done that if you are reading
this file)

2.  Put the "bin" files someplace useful (BINDIR).  If you have a central
repository of tools, put the "bin" directory there (i.e. if you
have /home/adm/bin, make a /home/adm/hostdb/bin and put the files
there).  For testing, you can put the "bin" directory anywhere,
even leave it where you untarred things initially.

3.  Add the "bin" directory to your PATH.

3.  Read the paper in docs/lisa2005-paper.pdf to understand the
configuration files.

4.  Create a directory called anything you want for storing your
data (DATADIR). Your data can live anywhere you want.  I call mine
/home/adm/hostdb/data and when I want to do testing I copy things
into a directory called ~/hostdb-test and do the tests I want right
there.

5.  Create a subdirectory in DATADIR called "out"

	mkdir $DATADIR/out
for example:
	mkdir /home/adm/hostdb/data/out

6.  In your shell, make an alias to make everything easier to work with.

sh-relatives:
	alias hmake='cd /home/adm/hostdb/data/out && make -f ../Makefile'

csh-relatives:
	alias hmake 'cd /home/adm/hostdb/data/out && make -f ../Makefile'

7.  Create the initial 4 files needed for hostdb to operate:

	zoneconf.txt destinations.txt and Makefile (plus some others):
		cp examples/goodstart/* DATADIR/.

	hostdb.txt:
		create from a BIND zone file using zone2hostdb,
			or your /etc/hosts file
			or your imagination.

8.  Create the files:

	cd $DATADIR
	hmake

9.  Review the data:

	cd $DATADIR/out
	ls
